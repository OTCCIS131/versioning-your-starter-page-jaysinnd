      <h2>Tech Stuff</h2>
      <p>I am very much a computer enthusiast. I have built my own desktop computers since 2000. Currently I run a dual desktop 
        setup so that I can stream to Twitch if I feel like it, or just use the second one as a music/video source while I am working.
        My main workstation has the following:

          <li class="list-group-item">16gb DDR4 RAM</li>

      <h2>Sports</h2>
      <p>Since I was about 24 yrs of age, I have played slow pitch mens softball. I have played at literally every level there is to 
        play at, anywhere from your conventional "beer league" on Friday nights, to traveling to Atlanta, GA to play on TV for a World 
        Championship. I am TERRIBLE in the field with a glove, but apparently, I can spin the ball really well, so I have that going for 
        me. Plus, you don't have to be good to play Catcher in slow pitch, or to be an Extra Hitter (EH). Below is a link to the current 
        team I play for this year, and their website that I built for the owner.

        <h2>Hobbies - Spare Time</h2>
          <p>In my spare time, I am trying to currently start a graphics/website business. This past summer I did quite a bit of work for local
            and upstart businesses, helping them with anything from logos, 'small' websites, to Facebook ad videos. I am extremely fond of using
            anything Adobe. Below is a list of programs I typically use...

        <h3>Family</h3>
          <p>My wife and I have 6 (yes, six) kids combined. I have three boys and one girl, while she has a boy and a girl. We also have 
            one cat and two dachsunds that we spoil more than any other animals on the face of the earth. Three of our boys are graduated 
            from High School already. One lives in Indiana near his dad, one also attends OTC for a CiS degree, and the other is just a bum 
            (to put it mildly). We also have two seniors in High School and one sophomore.
